# Guided Policy Search for In-Hand Manipulation
Code for my bachelor thesis [Guided Policy Search for In-Hand Manipulation](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Team/HanyAbdulsamad/Schneider_Bachelor_Thesis_2018.pdf)

The code is based on [Chelsea Finn's implementation](https://github.com/cbfinn/gps), but has been altered substantially.
